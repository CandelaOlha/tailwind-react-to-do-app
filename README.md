This is a solution to the [Todo app challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/todo-app-Su1_KokOW) I did as part of [Udemy's React JS + Next JS course](https://www.udemy.com/course/curso-react-js/).

## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Add new todos to the list
- Mark todos as complete
- Delete todos from the list
- Filter by all/active/complete todos
- Clear all completed todos
- Toggle light and dark mode
- **Bonus**: Drag and drop to reorder items on the list

## My process

### Built with

- Vite
- React JS
- Tailwind
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

By creating this app I was able to refresh key React JS concepts, such as component creation, use of props, useState and useEffect and logical operators for conditional classes.

### Continued development

Now that I've refreshed these React JS basics, my next step will be to work with an API to create a more complex application, with more information and using React Router.
